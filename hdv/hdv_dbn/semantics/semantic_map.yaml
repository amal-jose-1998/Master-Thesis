    name: tactical_high_interaction
    description: High interaction regime; decisions coupled to surrounding vehicles, gaps, and tactical constraints.

  s0:
    a0:
      name: free_flow_speed_modulation
      description: High-speed free-flow with little to no leader influence; frequent small accel/decel adjustments rather than steady cruising.
    a1:
      name: sustained_braking_following
      description: Sustained deceleration while following (interaction-driven braking).
    a2:
      name: constrained_acceleration
      description: Acceleration episodes but constrained by context (not pure free acceleration).
    a3:
      name: stable_following_with_micro_adjustments
      description: Stable car-following with mild control and limited speed change.
  s1:
    a0:
      name: freeflow_accel
      description: Acceleration-dominant behavior in the tactical regime; leader often present but interaction risk is low (very large TTC / non-critical gaps).
    a1:
      name: lane_change_speed_adjustments
      description: Lane change maneuver with associated speed adjustments.
    a2:
      name: constrained_following
      description: Constrained following with frequent speed corrections (often low-speed / stop-and-go effects), not purely steady.
    a3:
      name: car_following_sustained_braking
      description: Car-following with sustained braking in high-interaction context.
