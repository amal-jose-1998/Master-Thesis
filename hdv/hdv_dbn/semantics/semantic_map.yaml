    a0:
      name: free_flow_speed_modulation
      description: High-speed free-flow regime with little to no leader influence; frequent small accel/decel adjustments rather than steady cruising.
      indicators:
        - vx_last is highest within style-0 (fast free-flow motion)
        - front_exists_frac is low (leader often absent; low interaction)
        - ax_zero_frac is very low (not steady cruising)
        - ax_pos_frac is high and ax_neg_frac is non-trivial (frequent accel/decel micro-adjustments)
        - lane-change indicators ~0 (not lane-change driven)
    a1:
      name: sustained_braking_following
      description: Sustained deceleration while following (interaction-driven braking).
      indicators:
        - ax_neg_frac high; ax_last negative
        - front_exists_frac high
        - THW/TTC reduced relative to cruising
    a2:
      name: constrained_acceleration
      description: Acceleration episodes but constrained by context (not pure free acceleration).
      indicators:
        - ax_pos_frac high; vx_slope positive
        - front_exists_frac medium-to-high
        - TTC/THW not extreme but indicates presence of constraint
    a3:
      name: stable_following
      description: Stable car-following with mild control and limited speed change.
      indicators:
        - ax_zero_frac medium-high; low jerk
        - front_exists_frac high
        - THW/TTC moderate and stable

  s1:
    a0:
      name: cruising_or_freeflow_accel
      description: Tactical regime but currently not strongly constrained; may include free-flow acceleration.
      indicators:
        - ax_pos_frac moderate; vx_slope positive or near 0
        - interaction features not extreme
    a1:
      name: lane_change_speed_adjustments
      description: Lane change maneuver with associated speed adjustments.
      indicators:
        - lc_left_present or lc_right_present high
        - lateral motion present (vy/ay, lane relation changes)
        - ax may show adjustment (pos or neg)
    a2:
      name: constrained_following
      description: Following under constraints (gap/risk driven), not purely steady.
      indicators:
        - front_exists_frac high
        - THW/TTC relatively low; risk indicators elevated
        - ax shows corrections (pos/neg fractions not minimal)
    a3:
      name: car_following_sustained_braking
      description: Car-following with sustained braking in high-interaction context.
      indicators:
        - ax_neg_frac high; sustained decel
        - front_exists_frac high
        - TTC/THW low (more critical than s0 a1)
